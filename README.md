## Overview

Articles will be linked to their publisher website when possible, and open
access versions will be prioritized (e.g., PubMed).

There are two files for each group, an `.md` and `.bib` file. The Markdown file
(`.md`) contains a list of articles, along with a short description for each.
There is a corresponding BibTeX file (`.bib`) that mirrors the Markdown list
for ease of import into reference managers.
